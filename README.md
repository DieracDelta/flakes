My Nixos configuration files. Note that most of my dotfiles (after being rewritten to play nicely with nix) live in `./dotfiles`. This includes configurations for:

- sway
- wayland
- vim
- emacs
- zathura
- my deepfry script
- home-manager config
- global config
- my working gpu passthrough with a ryzen 3600 and XFX 560
